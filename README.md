## Introduction

**nf-core/resolvinf** is a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline that integrates **ResolVI** (Resolution of Variational Inference) and **scVIVA** (single-cell Variational Inference for Variational Analysis) for advanced spatial transcriptomics data analysis. This dual-method approach provides state-of-the-art noise correction, cell type prediction, and niche-aware differential expression analysis.

### Key Technologies

- **ResolVI**: Deep generative model for technical noise correction in spatial transcriptomics data, particularly effective for platforms like 10x Xenium
- **scVIVA**: Deep generative model for spatial transcriptomics that incorporates both cell-intrinsic and neighboring gene expression patterns for niche-aware differential expression analysis

The pipeline takes spatialdata zarr stores (typically generated by the SOPA processing pipeline) as input and performs:

- **Data preprocessing** with flexible annotation label support
- **ResolVI model training** with GPU acceleration for noise correction and cell type prediction
- **Differential abundance (DA) analysis** for spatial niche composition
- **scVIVA model training** for niche-aware analysis using ResolVI predictions
- **Niche-aware differential expression** analysis with spatial context
- **Comprehensive visualization** including spatial plots, UMAP embeddings, and comparative analyses

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Pipeline Summary

The pipeline consists of six main steps organized in two parallel workflows for maximum efficiency:

### ResolVI Workflow

1. **RESOLVI_PREPROCESS**: Converts spatialdata zarr stores to AnnData format with flexible annotation labels
2. **RESOLVI_TRAIN**: Trains ResolVI model, generates corrected counts, and produces cell type predictions
3. **RESOLVI_ANALYZE**: Performs differential abundance analysis for spatial niche composition
4. **RESOLVI_VISUALIZE**: Creates comprehensive visualizations (runs in parallel with scVIVA)

### scVIVA Workflow (runs in parallel after ResolVI training)

5. **SCVIVA_TRAIN**: Trains scVIVA model using ResolVI cell type predictions for niche-aware analysis
6. **SCVIVA_ANALYZE**: Performs niche-aware differential expression analysis with spatial context

This parallel architecture maximizes computational efficiency while providing complementary analyses:

- **ResolVI**: Focuses on noise correction and cell type prediction + spatial abundance analysis
- **scVIVA**: Leverages ResolVI predictions for advanced niche-aware differential expression

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation) (`>=23.04.0`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) (you can follow [this tutorial](https://singularity-tutorial.github.io/01-installation/)), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(you can use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) both to install Nextflow itself and also to manage software within pipelines. Please only use it within pipelines as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_.

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

   ```bash
   nextflow run nf-core/resolvinf -profile test,docker --outdir <OUTDIR>
   ```

   Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

   > - The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `shifter`, `charliecloud` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
   > - Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute.
   > - If you are using `singularity`, please use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Set the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options to be able to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
   > - If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

   ```bash
   nextflow run nf-core/resolvinf --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
   ```

## Input Requirements

### Samplesheet

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with 2 columns, and a header row as shown in the examples below.

```csv
sample_id,zarr_path
sample1,/path/to/sample1_spatialdata.zarr
sample2,/path/to/sample2_spatialdata.zarr
sample3,/path/to/sample3_spatialdata.zarr
```

| Column      | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sample_id` | Custom sample name. This entry will be identical for multiple sequencing libraries/runs from the same sample. Spaces in sample names are automatically converted to underscores (`_`). |
| `zarr_path` | Full path to spatialdata zarr store file. File should be generated by SOPA processing pipeline or compatible spatial transcriptomics preprocessing tool.                               |

An [example samplesheet](assets/samplesheet.csv) has been provided with the pipeline.

### Marker Genes

You can optionally provide a list of marker genes for focused analysis and visualization. This can be done in two ways:

1. **As a text file** (one gene per line):

   ```bash
   --marker_genes /path/to/marker_genes.txt
   ```

2. **As a comma-separated list in your config file**:
   ```nextflow
   params {
       marker_genes = ['EPCAM', 'CD3D', 'CD68', 'COL1A1', 'PECAM1']
   }
   ```

If no marker genes are specified, the pipeline will analyze all genes present in the dataset.

### Comparison Specifications

You can provide custom comparison specifications for both differential abundance and niche-aware differential expression analyses:

#### Differential Abundance Comparisons

```bash
--da_comparisons /path/to/da_comparisons.json
```

**JSON format example:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "tcells_vs_bcells",
    "group1": "T cells",
    "group2": "B cells"
  },
  {
    "name": "epithelial_vs_stromal",
    "group1": "Epithelial",
    "group2": "Stromal"
  }
]
```

#### scVIVA Niche-aware DE Comparisons

```bash
--scviva_comparisons /path/to/scviva_comparisons.json
```

**JSON format example:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "tumor_vs_normal_tcells",
    "group1": "T cells",
    "group2": "T cells",
    "condition1": "tumor",
    "condition2": "normal"
  }
]
```

Both parameters also support CSV format with equivalent column names.
